# Task ID: 4
# Title: Build Strategic Inference Engine (Basic)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop initial logic for inferring basic Counter-Strike 2 strategies from real-time game state data.
# Details:
Implement a rule-based or simple pattern-matching engine. This engine will analyze GSI data (e.g., player positions, utility usage, bomb status) to identify common CS2 strategies such as 'A-site rush', 'eco round', 'retake scenario', or 'mid control'. Use a state machine or decision tree approach.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for individual inference rules and patterns. Integration tests with simulated game states to verify correct strategy identification. Manual validation during live gameplay to confirm accurate strategic inferences.
