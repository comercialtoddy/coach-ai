# Task ID: 10
# Title: Integrate Tracker.gg, Leetify, and HLTV APIs
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement specific API calls and data fetching logic for Tracker.gg, Leetify, and HLTV.
# Details:
Utilize the generic API client (Task 9) to interact with the specific endpoints of Tracker.gg (for player statistics), Leetify (for detailed performance data), and HLTV (for professional match results and meta trends). Handle the unique API schemas and rate limits for each service. Implement robust error handling for API failures.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for individual API calls and data parsing for each service. Integration tests with live API endpoints (using development keys) to verify successful data fetching. Monitor API response times and error rates.
