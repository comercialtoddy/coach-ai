# Task ID: 9
# Title: Develop Generic External API Client & OAuth2 Module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a reusable module for secure external API access, including OAuth2 authentication for services like Tracker.gg, Leetify, and HLTV.
# Details:
Implement a generic HTTP client capable of handling various request types (GET, POST). Develop a robust OAuth2 flow for token acquisition, refresh, and secure storage of credentials (e.g., using Electron's `keytar` or OS keychain for sensitive data). Ensure proper error handling and retry mechanisms.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for the generic HTTP client and OAuth2 flow. Integration tests with mock OAuth2 providers and API endpoints to verify token management. Security review of credential storage and transmission.
