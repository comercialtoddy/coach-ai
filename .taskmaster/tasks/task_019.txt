# Task ID: 19
# Title: Develop Customizable Overlay Layouts
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enable users to personalize the in-game overlay layout and displayed information.
# Details:
Implement a drag-and-drop or configuration system within the UI that allows users to arrange, resize, and toggle different overlay widgets (e.g., mini-map, kill feed, AI suggestions, player stats). Persist user preferences using Electron's `electron-store` or a similar local storage mechanism.

# Test Strategy:
UI component tests for customization controls. Persistence tests to ensure settings are saved and loaded correctly. User acceptance testing to confirm ease of customization and desired functionality.
