# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Game State Complexity Analysis for AI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enable the AI to analyze and understand the complexity of current game situations, informing deeper analysis.
# Details:
Develop algorithms to quantify game state complexity. Metrics could include: number of active players, spatial distribution of players across the map, number of ongoing engagements, and utility availability. This complexity score will guide the AI in determining the depth and urgency of its analysis and recommendations.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for complexity calculation algorithms with various simulated game states. Manual review of complexity scores assigned to different scenarios (e.g., simple 1v1 vs. chaotic 5v5 retake). Verify that AI analysis adapts to complexity levels.
