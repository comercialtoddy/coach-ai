# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Token Optimization System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement the system to achieve a 70% token cost reduction for AI interactions by optimizing prompt size.
# Details:
Develop data summarization and filtering algorithms for GSI data before sending it to Gemini AI. Techniques could include: 1) Keyword extraction for critical events, 2) Entity recognition to focus on relevant players/objects, 3) State compression by only sending diffs or highly relevant subsets of the GSI payload. Aim to reduce the overall token count per prompt.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for summarization algorithms, verifying token count reduction. Benchmarking token usage against unoptimized prompts. Manual review of AI responses to ensure critical context is not lost due to optimization.
