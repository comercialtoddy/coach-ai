# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop AI-driven Tactical Recommendation Prioritization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement AI logic to prioritize tactical recommendations based on their real-time impact within the game.
# Details:
Extend the strategic inference engine to assign impact scores to potential actions or recommendations. This could involve a weighting system based on current game context (e.g., round score, team economy, player count, objective status). The AI should prioritize suggestions that have the highest potential to influence the round outcome.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for the prioritization scoring function. A/B testing different weighting schemes in simulated environments. User feedback and expert review to validate the relevance and impact of prioritized recommendations during live gameplay.
