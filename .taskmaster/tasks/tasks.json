        "details": "Develop a robust configuration management system. This includes: 1) Defining a clear structure for configuration files (e.g., JSON, YAML, or .env files) with support for environment-specific overrides (development, staging, production). 2) Implementing secure loading mechanisms for sensitive data like API keys and secrets, prioritizing environment variables and considering secure vault integration for production. 3) Designing and implementing a feature flag mechanism that allows dynamic enabling/disabling of features without code redeployment, potentially using a simple in-memory store or a dedicated service. 4) Creating a unified API or service layer for other application components to access configuration values and feature flag states. Ensure all sensitive data is excluded from version control (e.g., via .gitignore).",
        "testStrategy": "Unit tests for configuration loading logic, environment variable parsing, and feature flag evaluation. Integration tests to verify that different environments (e.g., 'development', 'production') load the correct and distinct configurations. Functional tests to confirm that application features respond correctly to changes in feature flag states. Manual security review to ensure no sensitive data is hardcoded or inadvertently exposed in logs or version control.",
