# Task ID: 15
# Title: Build Adaptive Trigger Optimization Model
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement machine learning to dynamically adjust AI trigger sensitivity based on real-time game context.
# Details:
Train a reinforcement learning model (e.g., Q-learning) or a supervised classification model that learns the optimal timing and conditions for AI insights. The model will use game state, opponent predictions, and user feedback (implicit or explicit) to minimize false positives and maximize the relevance and impact of AI triggers. This refines the Smart Trigger System.

# Test Strategy:
A/B testing in a controlled environment to compare trigger effectiveness. Monitor false positive/negative rates of AI suggestions. Collect user satisfaction data regarding the timeliness and relevance of AI insights.
