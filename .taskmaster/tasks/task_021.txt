# Task ID: 21
# Title: Develop Automated Tactical Callouts Module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 14, 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the module responsible for generating and delivering AI-driven tactical callouts.
# Details:
Integrate a text-to-speech (TTS) engine (e.g., Web Speech API or a cloud-based TTS service) or utilize pre-recorded audio assets. Implement logic to select and trigger specific callouts based on real-time game events, AI predictions (Task 14), and prioritized recommendations (Task 7). Examples: 'Enemy B site push', 'Rotate A', 'Need smoke mid'.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for callout selection logic. Manual audio quality review for TTS or pre-recorded assets. Integration tests with simulated game events to verify correct and timely callout triggers. User feedback on clarity and usefulness of callouts.
