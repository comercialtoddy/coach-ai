# Task ID: 17
# Title: Design & Develop Core Dashboard UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 7, 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the modern, intuitive dashboard for displaying real-time metrics and AI insights.
# Details:
Develop the main user interface using Electron's rendering capabilities (e.g., React, Vue, or Angular). Design a responsive dashboard layout that displays key real-time GSI data, AI recommendations, performance metrics, and pre-match briefings. Adhere to design principles of minimal cognitive load, information hierarchy, and dark mode optimization. Integrate charting libraries (e.g., Chart.js, D3.js) for data visualization.

# Test Strategy:
Component tests for individual UI elements. End-to-end tests to verify data binding and real-time updates. Usability testing with target users to gather feedback on clarity, ease of use, and cognitive load.
