# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Core Gemini AI Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Establish the initial connection and implement a basic prompt-response mechanism with Gemini AI for game state analysis.
# Details:
Set up an API client for Gemini AI, handling authentication (e.g., API keys). Implement a basic request-response cycle where parsed GSI data is sent to Gemini AI with an initial 'elite prompt system' context (e.g., 'Analyze current round state'). Process and log the AI's textual responses.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for the Gemini AI API client and authentication. Integration tests with the actual Gemini API (using a development key) to verify successful requests and valid responses. Manual verification of AI output for simple game states.
