# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Interactive Strategy Visualization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14, 17
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop UI components to visualize AI-inferred strategies and predictions on interactive maps.
# Details:
Implement interactive map overlays or mini-maps within the dashboard. Use technologies like Canvas API or WebGL (e.g., Pixi.js) to render predicted enemy positions, common choke points, AI-suggested tactical movements, and utility trajectories. Allow users to toggle different visualization layers.

# Test Strategy:
Visual regression tests to ensure consistent rendering. Manual verification of visualization accuracy against AI predictions. User feedback on the clarity and usefulness of the interactive visualizations.
