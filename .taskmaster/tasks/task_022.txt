# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop plugins for Discord and TeamSpeak to enable AI callouts and team coordination features within these voice communication platforms.
# Details:
For Discord, develop a bot or utilize webhooks to send AI-generated callouts to specific voice channels or text channels. For TeamSpeak, develop a client plugin using the TeamSpeak 3 SDK to play audio callouts directly through the user's voice client. Ensure seamless integration and minimal configuration for users.

# Test Strategy:
Integration tests with Discord and TeamSpeak servers. Manual testing of plugin installation and functionality. Verify that AI callouts are correctly transmitted and audible within the voice communication platforms.
