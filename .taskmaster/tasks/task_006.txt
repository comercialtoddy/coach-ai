# Task ID: 6
# Title: Establish Round Database & Event Detection
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement a local database to store per-round GSI data and detect significant game events.
# Details:
Design a relational database schema (e.g., SQLite) to store historical GSI snapshots for each round, player statistics per round, and detected events (kills, assists, bomb plants/defuses, utility usage). Implement event detection logic by comparing consecutive GSI states to identify changes and trigger event recording.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for database schema integrity and ORM operations (create, read, update). Integration tests for event detection logic with simulated GSI streams. Query the database to verify accurate storage and retrieval of round data and events.
