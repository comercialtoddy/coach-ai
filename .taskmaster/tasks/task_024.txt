# Task ID: 24
# Title: Implement Performance Optimization & Monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23
# Priority: high
# Description: Optimize the entire application to ensure low latency, minimal CPU overhead, and low memory footprint during gameplay.
# Details:
Conduct comprehensive profiling of the Electron application, GSI pipeline, and AI inference processes. Implement optimizations such as: efficient data structures, asynchronous processing for heavy tasks, code splitting, lazy loading for UI components, and aggressive garbage collection. Target <50ms end-to-end latency, <1% CPU overhead, and <100MB memory footprint during active gameplay.

# Test Strategy:
Performance benchmarking using profiling tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools, Node.js V8 profiler). Load testing with simulated game data. Continuous monitoring of CPU, memory, and latency metrics in development and staging environments. Verify adherence to specified performance targets.
