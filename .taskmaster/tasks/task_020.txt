# Title: Prototype Mobile Companion App (Data Display)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12, 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a basic mobile companion application prototype for displaying pre-match briefings and post-match analysis.
# Details:
Create a cross-platform mobile application prototype (e.g., using React Native or Flutter). This app will primarily consume data from the desktop application's backend or a cloud service to display aggregated stats, pre-match briefings, and post-match AI insights. Focus on read-only functionality for the initial prototype.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for data consumption and display logic. UI component tests for mobile layouts. Cross-device compatibility testing on various mobile operating systems and screen sizes. Manual verification of data synchronization.
