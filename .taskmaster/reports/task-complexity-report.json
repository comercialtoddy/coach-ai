			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Electron Project Setup & Build System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Electron project setup into individual steps for TypeScript, React, Tailwind, Vite for main, Vite for renderer, `tsconfig.json` configuration, `package.json` scripts, and basic `electron-builder` setup.",
			"reasoning": "This task is foundational and involves integrating multiple technologies (Electron, TypeScript, React, Tailwind, Vite, Electron Builder). Getting all these build systems and frameworks to work seamlessly together, especially Vite for both main and renderer processes, can be complex and time-consuming, setting the stage for the entire project."

		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "GSI HTTP Server Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Outline the steps for initializing the Express server, creating the GSI POST endpoint, implementing robust JSON parsing and validation, defining the state comparison logic for real-time event detection (kills, bomb, round), and integrating WebSockets for pushing updates to the renderer.",
			"reasoning": "While setting up an Express server is relatively straightforward, the core complexity lies in the robust parsing, validation, and especially the state comparison logic required to accurately detect specific in-game events from the GSI data. Integrating WebSockets for real-time communication adds another significant component."

			"taskTitle": "Multimodal AI Prompting (GSI + Screenshot)",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the process of constructing multimodal prompts for the Gemini API, including formatting GSI data into a concise text string, preparing the processed screenshot as an image part, and structuring the `generateContent` call. Also, specify the logic for robustly parsing the AI's multimodal response to extract actionable insights.",
			"reasoning": "The core complexity here lies in correctly structuring the multimodal prompt, ensuring both the structured GSI data and the image data are passed efficiently and interpreted by the AI. Parsing the AI's potentially free-form response to extract specific coaching insights adds another layer of complexity."
		},

			"reasoning": "This task involves significant data processing, aggregation, and reporting logic. It requires effectively combining data from multiple sources (GSI, AI, database) and transforming it into meaningful summaries and historical comparisons, which can be complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Configuration & Settings UI with Hotkey",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the design and implementation of the React-based settings panel with Tailwind CSS, including controls for overlay appearance (position, size, opacity), coaching intensity, and privacy settings. Specify the implementation of the global hotkey listener to toggle window visibility/click-through, and the persistence/loading of settings from the SQLite database.",
			"reasoning": "This task combines UI development with Electron main process features (global hotkey, window manipulation). Persisting and loading user settings, and ensuring immediate application of changes to the overlay, adds to the overall complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Performance Optimization & Anti-Cheat Compliance",
			"complexityScore": 10,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the continuous process of performance profiling (memory, CPU, GPU), identifying and resolving memory leaks, optimizing React rendering, optimizing image processing, and rigorously ensuring VAC compliance by verifying read-only GSI interactions, avoiding code injection, and conducting extensive testing on VAC-secured servers.",
			"reasoning": "This is an extremely critical and cross-cutting task that requires deep technical expertise in Electron, Node.js, React, and OS interactions. Performance optimization is often an iterative process, and anti-cheat compliance is paramount, as failure can lead to bans and render the entire application unusable. It impacts nearly every other component."
