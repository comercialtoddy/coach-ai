<!-- add here your goals 
For example:

I'm looking for a lightweight solution to SDK ABC since its too slow. find a better way to solve this.

<failure_reason>
<!-- add some failure examples
1. the current sdk used is not maintained anymore
2. the sdk we're using is bloated and heavy
3. the sdk we're using is too slow
-->

<technical_or_business_constraints>
<!-- 
1. only consider solutions with a MIT license
2. we're looking for typescript solutions only (no js)

Goal: <goals>.

Context:
- Attempted solution in `</path/to/files_and_folders>`: <summary>.
- Failure reason: <failure_reason>.
- Constraints: <technical_or_business_constraints>.

Task:
1. Propose a new approach that overcomes the failure.
2. Outline code changes in `</path/to/current_file>` (and any other required files).
3. Explain why this approach avoids the previous issue and will satisfy tests/performance targets.

Notes:
- Provide high-level plan plus key code snippets or pseudo-code.

Combine this snippet with the above if you want testing too:
- Acceptance criteria:
  - All tests in `</path/to/<test_file>>` must pass or new tests should be added.
  - `npm test` completes with zero failures and lint passes.
