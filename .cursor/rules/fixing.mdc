Task: Resolve lint and formatting problems in `</path/to/<target_scope>>`.

Known issues:
- <issue_1>
- <issue_2>

Requirements:
- Run `npm run lint` until zero errors or warnings.
- Apply Prettier formatting.
- Ensure `tsc` passes with no type errors.
- No behavioral changes.

Notes:
- Confine edits to `<target_scope>`.

Combine this snippet with the above if you want testing too:
- Acceptance criteria:
  - All tests in `</path/to/<test_file>>` must pass or new tests should be added.
  - `npm test` completes with zero failures and lint passes.
